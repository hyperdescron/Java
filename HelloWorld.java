    // Public is an access modifier there are 4 access modifiers
    // Which are public,protected,private and default

    // Class is a blueprint for creating objects
    // If you consider Humans as a class an object would be Jason or Alice
    // An object has state and behaviour
    // State of an object is its attributes and called instance variables
    // An example for Human class could be height attribute
    // Behaviour of an object is called methods
    // An example for Human class could be sleep behaviour

    // HelloWorld is the name of our class it has to match the file name
    // Here we have the reserved keyword static
    // If a variable or methods declared as static it means it belongs to the class rather than object
    // All objects of a class shares that classes static methods and variables
    // Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifier(variable) name
    // Here return type is declared as void
    // Void means the method doesn't return anything

    // And we have method named main
    // This is the entry point to every Java program
    // The program begins initialization from this main method
    // It accepts an array of String

    // System is a built in class you can observe this classes source code using ctrl+F12 shortcut
    // And finally we have println() method which prints out the value inside the parenthesis

    public static void main(String[] args){
